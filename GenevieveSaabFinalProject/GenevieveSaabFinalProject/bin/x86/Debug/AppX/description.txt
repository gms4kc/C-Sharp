Program Description: This UWP project is a game called "Cake Creator." There are two game modes: creative and challenge.
					 
					 In creative, users can freely click on the radio buttons to make any cake. There's also a button
					 when the cake is done that shows a positive comment. 
					 
					 In challenge, players need to try to match the customer's order and there's a button to submit 
					 the cake when they're done. If the cake is incorrect, "try again" will be shown in the comment 
					 box, otherwise there will be a positive comment. The open and save features allow players to 
					 save their points and come back to the same order later.

Program Requirements:
-Feature delivery: The target features are all included (two game modes, background music, save feature).

-Techniques: 
	-Loops: CreativeModel.cs lines 58-63
	-Methods: Many methods included in MainPage.xaml.cs, ChallengeModel.cs, and CreativeModel.cs
	-Classes: The classes I created are in ChallengeModel.cs and CreativeModel.cs
	-Inheritance: The ChallengeModel is a subclass of the CreativeModel to allow the subclass to have access to the superclass's
				  variables.
	-Lists: There are two string list, one in ChallengeModel.cs line 14 and the other in CreativeModel.cs line 20.
	-MVC: The models are ChallengeModel.cs and CreativeModel.cs. The view is found in MainPage.xaml. And the controller is in 
		 MainPage.xaml.cs.
    -Multithreading: A thread is used in CreativeModel.cs lines 18 (declaration), 44-48 (start), 56-64 (update), 70-73 (end).
	-Searching: A lot of searching through the string lists is done in MainPage.xaml.cs. Examples: CakeDoneButton_Click method 
				lines 573-599 and OrderReadyButton_Click method lines 306-350.
	-Exception Handling: MainPage.xaml.cs lines 318-349, 519-539, 575-598.

-Runtime: No issues with runtime and errors dealt with exception handling to avoid program crashing. 

-Documentation: This document, the video demo, code comments, and instructions in the program cover all aspects of application.
				Note about videos: The code demo shows all the code, and there's a separate game demo to show the features because only one
									window was able to be recorded at a time. Also, the music in the game demo didn't record well in the video.

-GUI: UI is laid out in MainPage.xaml with a uniform colorscheme and fonts with proper alignment and clearly labeled controls.

-Proposal: Organized proposal submitted on time.
